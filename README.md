Hi there, and thanks for visiting! This repository showcases my technical capabilities in SQL and data visualization through a collection of projects, case studies, and course exercises. You'll find examples ranging from complex SQL queries (featuring joins, CTEs, and optimization techniques) to interactive Tableau dashboards designed to transform raw data into actionable insights.

Below you'll find highlighted projects demonstrating my ability to:
